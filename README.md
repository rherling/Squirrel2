    - [Dr. Tracey Marks](https://www.youtube.com/@DrTraceyMarks) — “I am a psychiatrist in Atlanta with over 20 years experience. This channel teaches you about mental health issues and self-improvement. Why? Because education empowers.”
    - [Dr. Scott Eilers](https://www.youtube.com/@DrScottEilers) — “My goal for this channel is to put the highest quality information about depression and anxiety in the hands of the people who need it most; those who are living with it every day.”
    - [Therapy in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/@TherapyinaNutshell) — “… my mission is to make mental health resources easier to access. I take therapy skills and psychological research and condense them down into bite-sized nuggets of help.”
